Chatter:
-Post feed -> upload -> comment on that feed -> not allowed! (App should download data from SFDC after upload). This needs access to another object etc.
-Attachments do not show on feed comments. (Thats why you also can't take pictures in feed comments at the moment)
-Post feed -> write comment -> send -> Upload changes -> Post feed -> write comment -> send button and camerabutton do not work!

Safety:
If a near miss or injury incident is added, the count in the work safety does not update
Site safety slider does not fire the changed event if the label is pressed.

ToDo:
Have pictures added from gallery.
Clean and optimize code
Write good comments
Update Technical Documentation
